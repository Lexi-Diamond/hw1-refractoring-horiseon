In this project I consolodated unnessary elements in CSS, I added semantic elements in HTML and modified the corresponding CSS. I added a title to the webpage. I rearranged the CSS to flow with the HTML. I fixed the broken link in the nav bar to navigate to the "search engine optimization" section. I added alt descriptions to all images for accessability.

I have included line by line notes in my CSS file describing the changes I made.
